              <p className="text-gray-600 mb-8">
                In the middle of flourescent lights, sterile labs,
                and the endless scent of ethanol at university,
                where I was studying for my diploma in 
                Pharmaceutical Science, a second dream quitely
                ignited.

                It started late one evening, after a long day of
                pharmacology lectures.I sat by my desk,
                overwhelmed but restless.Somewhere deep
                inside, I craved to build- not just understand
                molecules, but to create entire worlds. I opened
                my old laptop, typed "How to build a website,"
                and unknowingly stepped into a new dimension.

                Every spare minute I had, between drug
                calculations and experiments, I spent learning
                HTML, CSS,and Python.I would code late into the
                night, sacrificing comfort,sometimes even sleep,
                just to see something come alive on my screen.
                The thrill of creating - from nothing but an idea
                and keystrokes - consumed me.

                Over time, as my confidence grew, I discovered
                that code was only part of my magic. <strong>Design</strong>
                - beautiful,intuitive,human-centered design-
                was the bridge between ideas and experiences.
                That is when I met UI/UX Design:the art of making
                technology feel effortless and alive.

                While my classmates mastered clinical trials, I
                was running my own silent experiments- testing
                wireframes,studying color psychology ,crafting
                interfaces that could one day touch millions. I was 
                no longer just studying science; I was studying
                how humans and technology dance together.

                That decision - to pursue two dreams instead of
                one - changed my life forever.

                Now, I do not just build websites or apps.
                <strong>I Design experiences, I write dreams into
                  existence and I create technologies that serve,
                  inspire and connect people around the world
